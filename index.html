	<p>
		 Hello, I'm Bella. An innovative and entrepreneurial minded computer science student. 
		 I am 4.69041575982 <sup> 2 </sup> or log <sub> 4.69041575982 </sub> x = 2
		 I enjoy learning new programming languages and seeing how I can apply them to interesting projects. 
		 My latest interests have been robotics and AI/ML.
		 I always think about how the future could be improved for our society and for our environment. 
		 My career goals are to work with an ethical and diverse team where I can be in an innovative and open-minded environment. 
		 I also love talking about the algorithmic bias in AI and brainstorming with others how we can improved future machines. 
		 My end-goal is definitely to have my own company where I can fuel all of my entrepreneurial projects.
		 For hobbies outside of programming...
